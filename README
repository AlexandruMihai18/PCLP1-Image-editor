	-Overview-

This image editor is capable of performing certain photoshop feature such as
rotating, cropping and applying an effect to a selected area. In addition, the
current image is locally memorized through a loading process and can be
transferred in another file by performing the save action. The accuracy of
the applied effects is enhanced by precised calculations, allowing a large
number of filters to be consecutively applied to the picture without
noticing effect disruptions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	-Memorization of the image-

The image consists of a structure that enherences certain information from
the input file: description of the pixels (through a matrix), the height and
width of the picture, the maximum intensity of the picture, as well as the
selected section at any given time (starting by selecting the entire image).
Each pixel includes a red, green and blue value for each of that respective
intensity (for a colored images), and a gray value (for grayscale pictures).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	-The loading function-

The input file is opened as a binary file and the info is read accordingly
to the image's type - standard file reading for ascii documents and binary
reading for binary files. Initially, the entire picture is selected. For
improved precision for future matrix multiplications the matrix of pixels
includes decimale values.

The standard command pattern: LOAD <file_name>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	-The selection function-

Two possible selections are available: for the entire picture or for cardinal
coordinates in the matrix. Erroneous commands or invalid coordinates will
result in displaying a respective error message. Until further select
instructions the following operations will be restricted to the select area.

The standard command pattern for full select: SELECT ALL
The standard command pattern for partial select: SELECT <x1> <y1> <x2> <y2>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	-The rotation function-

Two possible rotations are available: for the entire picture or for a certain
square selection. The rotation angle is restricted to multiples of 90, other
values being treated as unsupported. The process takes place inside an
auxiliary matrix that will be overwritten in the main image.

The standard command for rotate: ROTATE <angle> (angle = multiple of 90)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	-The crop function-

The cropped image is the result of freeing the old pixel matrix and including
only the pixel from the selected area.

The standard crop command: CROP

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	-The filters function-

Certainly the most expected feature of an image editor, the apply section
includes 4 filters: EDGE, SHARPEN, BLUR, GAUSSIAN_BLUR. Each pixel in the
selected are is going to the process of applying a kernel, resulting in a new
value based on the kernel of the effect itself and the neighbours of the
pixel. Considering that the value might be lower than 0 or exceed 255
(the maximum allowed intensity), a clamp function is being used in order to
restrict the value of the pixel to this interval. After the affected matrix
is fully built inside an auxiliary matrix, the overwritten process will happen
inside the main picture.

The standard command: APPLY <filter>
(filter = EDGE/SHARPEN/BLUR/GAUSSIAN_BLUR)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	-The saving function-

Very similar to the load function, the save function opens a binary file
and includes all the required information for future actions on the picture.
The image could be saved either in ascii format on binary. The decimal
values inside the matrix are rounded to the closest integer and casted to
an unsinged char in order to follow the standard format on a picture.

The standard command: SAVE <file_name> [ascii]
*the [ascii] argument may not be included
